# Full Stack Assignment

Dear interviewee,

Welcome to the assignment.

All your assignment code instances must be removed from the internet after your next interview, do not share them with anyone.

This assignment consists of creating a frontend application using this template URL:
- https://codesandbox.io/s/github/empitwa/assignment-frontend 

...and a backend application using this template URL:

- https://replit.com/github/empitwa/assignment-backend \
  (The program entry point is `main.py`. Be sure that the variables below are set in the `.replit` file ( [**unhide it first!**](https://docs.replit.com/programming-ide/configuring-repl) )
  ```toml
  language = "python3"
  entrypoint = "main.py"
  ```

Create the application environments using the templates at the above URLs.

While you are not required to complete all of the tasks mentioned in the code, we encourage you to explain what you tried and what approaches you took while working on
them.

Submit your solution (the links to your applications) by e-mail or other allowed means at least 24 hours before your next interview.

We discourage the use of ChatGPT or any other AI Ghostwriting programs for this assignment.
